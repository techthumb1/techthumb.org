## About Me

My name is Jason Robinson. I am a Gemini, so I often 
blame my twin for setting me on this relentless journey, 
he's the daredevil, and I am the brain. However, more about me:
- I am an avid learner of all things, emphasis on Technology.
- I see challenges as solutions waiting to be solved.
- I thrive by myself, but excel in a team environment.
- I love people, but appreciate the silence of solitary.
