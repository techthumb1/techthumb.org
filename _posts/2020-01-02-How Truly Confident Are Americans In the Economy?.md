Is High Consumer Confidence, represented by Increases in Consumer Spending?


---

Since 2009, the economy, other than in times of war, is always one, if not the top, concern of many, if not all adult Americans. Having a robust economy is essential for a particular way of life that many have become accustomed to. There is no question that the American economy is doing well; however, has American's confidence in the economy had a  significant effect on Personal Consumption Expenditures?

According to recent Gallup polling numbers, economic concerns in the U.S. are at an all-time low, somewhere around %12 respectively, especially from where it once was ten years ago, a little after the Great Recession of 2008, at around %86, for Americans concerns with the Economy.
Personal consumption expenditures can be a significant indicator in regards to the confidence of consumers within the economy. When PCE is high, it suggests that individual Americans are more comfortable spending their disposable income.Â 

Personal consumption expenditures are shown by the BEA in current dollars and chained dollars since 2012. Personal consumption expenditures form the basis for the reporting of the PCE Price Index, which is detailed both comprehensively using all categories of PCE and excluding food and energy, which is known as the Core PCE Price Index.

Non-durable goods are considered "transitory," meaning that their life expectancy is typically less than three years. These items are also typically less costly and include products like makeup, gasoline, and clothing.
