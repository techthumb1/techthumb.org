Personal consumption expenditures are shown by the BEA in current dollars and chained dollars since 2012. Personal consumption expenditures form the basis for the reporting of the PCE Price Index, which is detailed both comprehensively using all categories of PCE and excluding food and energy, which is known as the Core PCE Price Index.
